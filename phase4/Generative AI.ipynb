      "\n",
      "3. **Campo Grande (MS)**: This option is a bit more unusual, but I'm intrigued by the rich culture and natural beauty of Mato Grosso do Sul. It's time to explore the Pantanal region and experience the Wild West of Brazil.\n",

    "## Differences Between the Brief and Detailed Templates\n",
    "### The Brief Template provides a concise and straightforward overview of travel recommendations, listing top destinations, recommended hotels, and average costs in a simple bullet-point format. It focuses on delivering key information quickly without delving into detailed explanations or personalization. In contrast, the Detailed Template offers a comprehensive and structured analysis, including a rationale for the recommendations, a deeper explanation of how the choices align with the userâ€™s profile, and even suggests modifications to the itinerary (e.g., swapping Aracaju for Vitoria). It also breaks down the estimated budget and explains how it fits the userâ€™s spending patterns, making it more personalized and context-rich. While the Brief Template is easy to read and quick to digest, the Detailed Template is more informative, adaptive, and tailored to the userâ€™s specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcomes of Each Template\n",
    "### The Brief Template produces a quick and easy-to-read summary of travel recommendations, ideal for users who want a fast overview without needing in-depth explanations or personalized insights. It highlights the top destinations, hotels, and costs in a clear and concise manner. On the other hand, the Detailed Template generates a thorough and personalized travel plan that considers the userâ€™s preferences, spending habits, and cluster profile. It provides a detailed explanation of why the recommendations are suitable, suggests alternative options, and offers a breakdown of the budget, making it more informative and tailored. The Brief Template is perfect for users seeking a snapshot of their options, while the Detailed Template is better suited for those who want a well-reasoned and customized travel plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Template:\n",
    "### The choice between the two templates depends on the userâ€™s needs and preferences. The Brief Template is better for users who prefer quick, concise information and do not require detailed explanations or personalized insights. It is ideal for those looking for a fast overview of travel options. In contrast, the Detailed Template is better for users who want a comprehensive, personalized travel plan with detailed reasoning behind the recommendations. It is particularly valuable for users who value tailored suggestions and are willing to spend more time reviewing a more complex but highly relevant travel plan. In summary, the Brief Template is suitable for simplicity and speed, while the Detailed Template excels in personalization and depth.\n"
